# Description of the assignment
This Assignment is aimed to be a basic example of the of the Ui used in
the Batman Arkham game series. The screen that pops up on Batmans wrist and 
displays various functions for batman to access. In this case Batman would have constant
view of his most wanted from the Batman under the red hood series, access to a radar,and the
ability to call either alfred, the batmobile or the batplane.

# Instructions
Clicking the buttons
	Click each name withing each button in order to activate the buuton
	Look to the left hand side of the screen in order to see the result

# How it works
	

# What I am most proud of in the assignment
	If i am going to be honest about this assignment, i did find it difficult to do even with the amount of time i put into it
	Implementing the radar and understanding how it worked took some time, as did implementing a correct version of the buttons.
	However i am personally most proud of how it looks. I wanted to get the old school look and add my own flare to it and i 
	feel like i have achieved that, even if the project is not perfect.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
